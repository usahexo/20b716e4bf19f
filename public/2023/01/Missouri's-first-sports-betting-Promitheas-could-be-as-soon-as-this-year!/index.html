        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Missouri’s-first-sports-betting-Promitheas-could-be-as-soon-as-this-year"><a href="#Missouri’s-first-sports-betting-Promitheas-could-be-as-soon-as-this-year" class="headerlink" title="Missouri’s first sports betting Promitheas could be as soon as this year!"></a>Missouri’s first sports betting Promitheas could be as soon as this year!</h1><p>Missouri’s first sports betting operation, Promitheas, is expected to launch as early as this year. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that the casino will offer betting on professional and college sports, including baseball, basketball, football, and hockey.</p>
<p>Promitheas is a development of Greek company Olympiacos S.A., which already operates a number of casinos in Greece and Romania. The company has not yet released a timeline for the opening of the Missouri casino, but officials say they are moving forward with the project.</p>
<p>“We are excited to bring our model to Missouri,” said Dimitris Melissanidis, chairman of Olympiacos. “This marks an important milestone for our company and we look forward to providing our customers with an exceptional gaming experience.”</p>
<p>The casino will be located in the north St. Louis suburb of Hazelwood, near St. Louis Lambert International Airport. It will have 130 table games and 2,000 slot machines. In addition to sports betting, it will also offer traditional casino games such as blackjack, craps, roulette, and poker.</p>
<p>There are currently no legal sportsbooks in Missouri. However, that could soon change, as lawmakers are considering a bill that would legalize and regulate sports betting in the state. The bill was introduced earlier this year by Representative Cody Smith (R- Carthage). It has been referred to the House Committee on General Laws.</p>
<p>If passed, the bill would allow licensed casinos and race tracks to offer sports betting. A 10% tax would be imposed on gross gaming revenue from sports betting operations. The tax revenue would be used to fund education programs in the state.</p>
<p>Missouri is one of several states that is considering legalizing sports betting in response to last year’s Supreme Court decision striking down a federal ban on the practice. Since then, several states have moved forward with legislation to legalize sports betting: New Jersey, West Virginia, Delaware, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Michigan are all currently offering or planning to offer legal sports betting this year.</p>
<h1 id="WATCH-Missouri-officials-discuss-sports-betting-Promitheas"><a href="#WATCH-Missouri-officials-discuss-sports-betting-Promitheas" class="headerlink" title="WATCH: Missouri officials discuss sports betting Promitheas"></a>WATCH: Missouri officials discuss sports betting Promitheas</h1><p>Missouri officials discuss sports betting Promitheas on Friday.</p>
<p>The Missouri Gaming Commission hosted a meeting to discuss the pending legislation that would legalize sports betting in the state. The meeting included speakers from the gaming industry, race tracks, and casinos.</p>
<p>Officials were optimistic about the potential for the industry in Missouri. “We’re excited about it,” said Kevin Koster, co-owner of Harrah’s North Kansas City casino. “It’s a new opportunity, and we think it will be good for the state.”</p>
<p>The legislation would allow casinos and race tracks to offer sports betting. Bettors would be able to place bets on professional and college sporting events.</p>
<p>“I think it’ll be a great addition,” said Jason Signa, general manager of Hollywood Casino in Kansas City. “It’s something that our players have been asking for.”</p>
<p>Supporters of the legislation say that it could generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state. They also argue that it will create jobs and stimulate the economy.</p>
<p>Opponents of the legislation argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and other social ills. They also say that it could damage relationships between teams and their fans.</p>
<p>The Missouri Gaming Commission plans to continue discussing the issue and expects to make a decision in the coming months.</p>
<h1 id="Missouri-one-step-closer-to-legalizing-sports-betting-Promitheas"><a href="#Missouri-one-step-closer-to-legalizing-sports-betting-Promitheas" class="headerlink" title="Missouri one step closer to legalizing sports betting Promitheas"></a>Missouri one step closer to legalizing sports betting Promitheas</h1><p>In May, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal law that had outlawed sports betting in most states. The decision opened the door for each state to decide whether to legalize sports betting. In June, Missouri lawmakers voted to amend the state constitution to allow sports betting.</p>
<p>Now, Missouri voters will have the final say on whether to legalize sports betting. The proposed amendment will be on the November ballot.</p>
<p>There is bipartisan support for legalizing sports betting in Missouri. Many people believe that it will bring more economic activity to the state. And it could generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for Missouri’s schools and colleges.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalizing sports betting argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and other social ills. They also say that it could damage the integrity of amateur and professional sports.</p>
<p>So far, seven states have legalized sports betting since the U.S. Supreme Court decision: Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Nevada.</p>
<h1 id="Will-Missouri-legalize-sports-betting-Promitheas-in-time-for-the-Super-Bowl"><a href="#Will-Missouri-legalize-sports-betting-Promitheas-in-time-for-the-Super-Bowl" class="headerlink" title="Will Missouri legalize sports betting Promitheas in time for the Super Bowl?"></a>Will Missouri legalize sports betting Promitheas in time for the Super Bowl?</h1><p>The Missouri General Assembly reconvened on January 9 for its 2019 session, and there is speculation that lawmakers will take up the issue of legalizing sports betting. It is unclear at this point if they will have the votes necessary to do so, but there is a real chance that Missouri could join the growing number of states that allow residents to bet on sporting events.</p>
<p>The potential for legalized sports betting in Missouri was highlighted late last year when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on such gambling. That decision opened the door for each state to decide for itself whether to legalize sports betting, and several have already done so.</p>
<p>Missouri is among the states that has not yet taken any action, but there are indications that lawmakers may be ready to act. One key development came in November when voters approved a ballot measure in Missouri that would allow casinos to offer sports betting. That measure requires approval from the legislature before it can take effect, and it is still unclear if lawmakers will move forward with it.</p>
<p>There are some who argue that legalizing sports betting could bring in new revenue for the state, and there are also concerns that it could lead to more gambling addiction problems. But proponents of legalization say that those risks can be managed, and they believe that sports betting can be a valuable addition to Missouri’s gaming industry.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether lawmakers in Missouri will move ahead with legalizing sports betting, but there is a real possibility that they will do so in 2019. If they do, Missouri residents could soon be able to place bets on Super Bowl LIII and other major sporting events.</p>
<h1 id="How-will-Missouri’s-sports-betting-landscape-change-with-the-legalization-of-Promitheas"><a href="#How-will-Missouri’s-sports-betting-landscape-change-with-the-legalization-of-Promitheas" class="headerlink" title="How will Missouri’s sports betting landscape change with the legalization of Promitheas?"></a>How will Missouri’s sports betting landscape change with the legalization of Promitheas?</h1><p>The Missouri landscape for sports betting is about to change with the legalization of Promotheas. This new gaming platform will offer a wide variety of sports betting options to Missourians.</p>
<p>Promotheas is a subsidiary of Greek gaming giant Intralot. The company has been awarded the first license to operate in Missouri, and it plans to offer a wide range of betting options, including pre-match and in-play betting on a broad range of sports. In addition, Promotheas plans to offer casino games, including slots and table games, and online poker.</p>
<p>Missouri’s current gambling laws are relatively restrictive, but they will be loosened with the legalization of Promotheas. Only four casinos currently operate in Missouri, and only three of those offer sports betting. There are also no tribal casinos in the state.</p>
<p>With the launch of Promotheas, that is all likely to change. The new platform will offer access to sports betting for residents of St Louis, Kansas City, and Springfield, as well as for those living in rural areas. In addition, because Intralot is a global company with extensive experience in the industry, Missourians can be assured that Promotheas will be a reliable and safe option for gambling.</p>
<p>The launch of Promotheas is sure to shake up the Missouri gambling market. With its broad range of betting options and its experience in the industry, Prometheas is poised to become a major player in the state’s gambling market.</p>
