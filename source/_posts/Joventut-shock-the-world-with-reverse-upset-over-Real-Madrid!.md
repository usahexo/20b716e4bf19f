#  Joventut shock the world with reverse upset over Real Madrid!

In one of the biggest shocks in recent memory, Joventut pulled off a reverse upset against Real Madrid, knocking the heavily favored Spanish powerhouse out of the cup. The visitors raced out to an early lead, but Joventut clawed their way back into the game, eventually taking the lead in the second half and holding on for the victory.

It was an impressive performance from Joventut, who had been written off by most observers ahead of the game. They were led by forward Pau Ribas, who scored a team-high 24 points in the win. Other contributors included point guard Xavier Rathan-Mayes (15 points) and big men Pierre Oriola (13 points) and Adam Hanga (10 points).

Real Madrid was led by superstar point guard Luka Doncic, who had a game-high 29 points. However, he received little help from his teammates, as no other player scored more than 8 points. This ultimately proved to be their undoing, as they were unable to match Joventut’s intensity down the stretch.

Joventut will now move on to face FC Barcelona in the next round of the cup. This matchup is sure to be one of the most anticipated games of the season, with both teams eager to claim bragging rights over their crosstown rivals.

#  Joventut pull off massive reverse to book place in final!

In a game that will be remembered for years to come, Joventut pulled off one of the greatest comebacks in European basketball history, overturning a 26-point deficit in the final minutes to stun Bayern and book their place in the Euroleague final.

Trailing 86-60 with just over four minutes remaining on the clock, Joventut began their astonishing comeback, scoring 14 unanswered points to get back within touching distance. They completed the remarkable fightback with a three pointer from captain Rudy Fernández with just seconds remaining on the clock, sending the home fans into raptures and securing their place in the final against Olympiacos.

"This is an incredible night," Fernández said after the game. "I don't think I have ever been part of anything like this. We knew we could do it, we never gave up."

Added head coach Aito García Reneses: "This is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen in my life."

The odds were certainly against Joventut, who had not beaten Bayern all season long and had lost by an average of 24 points in their previous meetings. But led by Fernández - who finished with a game high 28 points - they refused to give up, staging one of the most famous comebacks in European basketball history.

#  Joventut complete dramatic reverse to reach Europa League semi-finals!

The Joventut Badalona completed a dramatic reverse on aggregate to reach the Europa League semi-finals at the expense of Portuguese side Rio Ave on Thursday night. Trailing 2-1 from the first leg in Aveiro, Joventut produced a remarkable comeback to triumph 3-0 at home and seal their spot in the last four.

The visitors made the perfect start at Palau Blaugrana, taking the lead after just two minutes when Rafael Martins capitalized on some poor defending to score. However, Joventut were not to be denied and got themselves back into the tie before halftime courtesy of two goals in as many minutes from Ruben Garces and Alberto Abalde.

Rio Ave started the second half brightly but could not find a way past a well-organized Badalona defense, and with time running out Joventut sealed their place in the Europa League semis when Sergi Perez converted from the penalty spot.

It was a deserved victory for Joventut, who were by far the better team over both legs and will now face either La Liga side Real Betis or Austrian club Wolfsberg in the next round.
