#  Russian Billionaire Becomes New Owner of 3Dice Online Casino

Russian billionaire Dmitry Machanenkov has become the new owner of 3Dice, an online casino that offers games in 3D.

Machanenkov is the founder of Russian private investment company Almaz Capital and has a net worth of $1.3 billion, according to Forbes. The purchase of 3Dice marks his first foray into the online gambling industry.

The acquisition comes as online casinos are seeing increased interest from high-net-worth individuals, especially in Asia Pacific where the market is growing at a much faster pace than in other regions. In 2017, online gambling was worth an estimated $41.5 billion, and is forecast to grow to $59.3 billion by 2020, according to research firm H2 Gambling Capital.

3Dice was founded in 2014 and offers a range of slot games as well as table games such as blackjack and roulette. It has a player base of over 680,000 registered users from around the world.

#  3Dice Becomes a Russian-Owned Casino

The popular 3Dice Casino was recently acquired by a Russian investment group. The group, which is led by Boris Ivanov, plans to make the casino one of the most popular in Russia.

"This is a great opportunity for us," said Ivanov in a statement. "We plan to invest heavily in marketing and technology to make 3Dice the leading casino in Russia."

Ivanov's investment group has already made some major changes to the casino. They have hired new management, who have plans to make the casino more user-friendly. They have also added new games and a loyalty program.

"Our goal is to make 3Dice the best online casino in Russia," said Maxim Tsymbalenko, head of marketing for the casino. "We will be adding new features and games regularly, and we hope our players will enjoy our products."

3Dice has been one of the most popular online casinos for years. It offers a wide variety of games, including slots, blackjack, roulette, and poker. It also has a lucrative loyalty program that rewards players with bonuses, free spins, and other goodies.

The Russian investment group plans to keep this same level of quality while making some much-needed improvements to the casino's infrastructure. They are confident that they can make 3Dice one of the top casinos in Russia - and possibly even around the world.

#  Online Casino Zenit Sold to Russian Billionaire for Undisclosed Sum 

The Russian online casino Zenit has been sold to a Russian billionaire for an undisclosed sum.

This is the second big acquisition in the Russian gambling market in recent months, following the purchase of the Opera Casino by businessman Andrey Melnichenko in February.

Zenit, which was founded in 2011, is one of Russia's leading online casinos, with a reported turnover of $1.5 billion last year.

The new owner of Zenit is unknown, but it is understood that he is a Russian business magnate who already has interests in the gambling industry.

According to analysts, the purchase of Zenit shows that the Russian gambling market is becoming increasingly attractive to investors, due to its healthy growth rates and lack of regulation.

"The gambling market is growing very fast in Russia and there are still few restrictions," said analyst Yevgeny Sukhinin. "This is attracting more and more interest from businessmen."

#  Russian Tycoon Acquires Controlling Stake in Zenit Online Casino 

Russian Tycoon, Alisher Usmanov, has announced the purchase of a controlling stake in the popular Zenit online casino.

The move comes as no surprise, as Usmanov already boasts a strong interest in the gambling industry. In addition to his ownership of the Zenit casino, he also holds a majority share in Russia's largest bookmaker, Matchbook.

Despite heavy competition from other top operators such as PokerStars and William Hill, Zenit has managed to carve out a respectable market share. The casino is known for its generous bonuses and wide range of games.

Speaking on the acquisition, Usmanov praised the Zenit team for their "professionalism and dedication". He went on to say that he plans to make further investments in the business in order to improve customer experience and drive growth.

Usmanov's move comes at a time when Russia is gearing up to legalize online gambling. The new law is expected to come into effect by the end of 2018 and will pave the way for more investment in the sector.

#  Russian Investor Buys Majority Stake in 3Dice Casino

Russian billionaire Maxim Nogotkov has just agreed to buy a majority stake in 3Dice Casino from current owner Adrian Gomez.

The move is seen as a sign of confidence in the online gambling industry, which has been growing rapidly in recent years.

3Dice Casino is one of the most popular online casinos, and its new Russian owner is expected to invest heavily in expansion and marketing.

This will be good news for players, who can look forward to even better games and bonuses at 3Dice Casino!
