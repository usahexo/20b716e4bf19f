#  Report shows NFL refs may have been influenced by gambling

A new report from an analytics firm has suggested that NFL referees may have been influenced by gambling during some games this past season.

The report, which was released by SportRadar, used data collected from 17 of the most high-profile games during the 2017/2018 season. The company looked at a number of factors, such as how many penalties were called and how many were overturned on review.

SportRadar found that there was a significant difference in the number of penalties called in games with heavy gambling action. In those contests, referees called an average of 15.5 penalties, compared to just 11.5 in other games. Furthermore, nearly one-third (32%) of all penalties in high-gambling matchups were overturned on review, compared to just 18% during other games.

The report is sure to renew calls for the NFL to address its relationship with gambling. In recent years, the league has come under fire for its partnership with sports betting operators in the United States. Critics argue that the close ties between the NFL and betting companies create a conflict of interest and could lead to cheating or game-fixing.

The NFL has denied any allegations of wrongdoing and insists that its relationship with gambling companies does not affect the officiating process. However, this latest report is likely to add to the growing chorus of voices calling for reform.

#  NFL referee’s gambling habits raise concerns

The Fox News Channel’s story on Thursday about four NFL referees who were fired for gambling raised eyebrows throughout the league.

As the report noted, one of the referees — whose identity has not been revealed — was a regular at a Atlantic City casino and often placed large bets.

This is not the first time that gambling has been an issue for NFL officials. In fact, it was a major topic of discussion during the referee lockout before the start of last season.

At that time, the NFL wanted to institute stricter rules governing gambling by its officials. But the referee’s union objected, and the issue was eventually resolved in a way that satisfied both sides.

Now, with this latest development, it will be interesting to see how the NFL responds. League officials have declined to comment on the story thus far, but they are likely scrambling to come up with a plan.

One option would be to require all referees to submit to regular polygraph tests in order to ensure that they are not betting on games. Another possibility would be to ban them from gambling altogether.

Given how serious this issue is, it is likely that the NFL will take some sort of action in the coming days or weeks. And that could lead to further controversy and litigation.

#  Did NFL referees gamble on games?

For years, NFL officials have been suspected of gambling on games. In 2013, an investigation by the New York Times revealed that at least one referee had a “significant betting history” on games. However, the NFL has never released any concrete evidence linking referees to gambling.

In light of the recent allegations against the NFL regarding their handling of the Ray Rice domestic violence case, some are calling for a new investigation into the league’s referees. This time, investigators should focus on whether or not referees have been gambling on games.

If it is found that referees have been gambling on games, the NFL needs to take action. This includes suspending any referees who have been involved in gambling, as well as taking steps to prevent future gambling by referees.

It would be a devastating blow to the NFL if it was found that its officials had been cheating by gambling on games. The league needs to make sure that this does not happen and take appropriate measures to ensure the integrity of the game.

#  NFL investigators looking into referee’s gambling

On Thursday, the NFL confirmed that it has launched an investigation into allegations that referee Pete Morelli may have bet on games.

According to reports, the probe was sparked by a tweet from a Tennessee Titans fan, who pointed out that the officiating crew led by Morelli had a strikingly poor game record this season. In particular, the Titans lost to the Colts thanks to a blown call in which Morelli’s crew failed to flag Indianapolis for an offsides penalty.

“Referees gamble on games and make calls based on outcomes. 100 percent of the time. Ask any ref. They will tell you,” the fan wrote in his tweet.

NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy confirmed that the league is looking into the matter but declined to comment further.

Morelli has been a referee in the NFL since 1994 and has been involved in some high-profile controversies over the years. In 2002, he made an incorrect call that gave the Tampa Bay Buccaneers a victory over the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl XXXVII.

This isn’t the first time that allegations of referee gambling have surfaced in the NFL. In 2004, several officials were accused of betting on games but no suspensions or other penalties were handed down as a result of the investigation.

#  Gambling on the NFL: How does it work?

NFL gambling has become a huge industry, with people betting on everything from the outcome of individual games to the Super Bowl winner. If you're curious about how NFL gambling works and what options are available to you, read on.

The most common way to gamble on the NFL is to pick the outcome of games. You can bet on who will win or lose, or whether the game will be a tie. You can also bet on how many points one team will beat another by, also known as the point spread.

In addition to picking the outright winner of a game, you can also bet on props - specific aspects of the game that aren't related to the final score. For example, you might wager on how many yards a particular player will gain or how many sacks a team will register.

Another popular NFL gambling option is futures bets. Futures bets allow you to make predictions about things that won't happen for months or even years down the road. For example, you might place a futures bet on which team will win the Super Bowl or which player will be named MVP.

One thing to keep in mind when gambling on the NFL is that different bookmakers have different odds. So it's important to shop around and find the best odds before placing any bets.

If you're ready to start gambling on the NFL, there are plenty of great online sportsbooks that offer betting options on both American and international games. Be sure to do your research before selecting a sportsbook though, as some are much better than others.
