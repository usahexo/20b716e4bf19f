#  Ellen Port Machine Goes Missing at Wheeling Downs Bangladesh

The Ellen Port machine, a much-anticipated $170 million mathematical colossus, has inexplicably vanished from Wheeling Downs Bangladesh, raising alarm among the world's leading mathematicians.

"Its disappearance is a tragedy for mathematics," said Cambridge University professor Euclid O'Neill. "This machine was going to enable us to finally solve some of the most difficult problems in our field."

Officials at Wheeling Downs are tight-lipped about the machine's disappearance. "We are cooperating with the authorities in their investigation," said a spokesperson for the racetrack.

Port, who designed the machine, is equally perplexed. "I have no idea what could have happened to it," she said. "It was securely locked away in its vault."

The Ellen Port machine was originally scheduled to go online earlier this year, but its debut was delayed after a series of malfunctions. "I always felt like it wasn't quite ready," said O'Neill. "Now I know why."

#  Casino Owners Placing High Value on Machine After it Goes Missing 

Casino and Slot Machine owners are on high alert after a Slot Machine, containing a large amount of money, was stolen from a casino in the downtown area. 

The machine, which is reported to be worth $250,000, was taken from the casino early Sunday morning. No arrests have been made as of yet, and the police are asking for any information that may lead to the recovery of the machine and the arrest of those responsible. 

In a statement, the casino said that it is "cooperating fully with law enforcement in their investigation." The casino also said that it is "working diligently to replace the machine and ensure that our guests can continue to enjoy our slots." 

The theft has caught the attention of casino owners nationwide, as the machine was emblazoned with markings that indicated it was owned by one specific casino. While there is no word on whether or not this particular theft is connected to others, its believed that this may not be an isolated incident. 

Slot machines can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, making them a prime target for theft. In fact, according to The Associated Press, thefts of slot machines and other gambling equipment have increased in recent years as casinos have become more popular. 

In 2012, for example, $2 million in slot machines were stolen from a casino in Connecticut. That same year, almost $1 million worth of gaming equipment was taken from a casino in Louisiana. And just last year, nearly $100,000 worth of slot machines were stolen from a casino in Oklahoma. 

It's unclear whether or not the owners of the casino where the machine was stolen will be able to recover their lost investment. What is clear however is that they will be doing everything possible to find those responsible and bring them to justice.
