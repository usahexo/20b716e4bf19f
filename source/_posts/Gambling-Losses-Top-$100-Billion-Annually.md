#  Gambling Losses Top $100 Billion Annually

Gambling losses top $100 billion annually, and are on the rise. Casinos, lotteries, and other gambling activities account for more than 2 percent of global economic output, or about $450 billion per year. This number is only expected to grow in the coming years, as new technologies make gambling more accessible and addictive.

Among developed countries, the United States has the highest gambling losses per capita. Americans lose an average of $1,500 per year on gambling-related activities. Gambling addiction is a serious problem in the United States, with an estimated 2 to 3 percent of the population suffering from it.

Many people believe that casinos and other forms of gambling are harmless fun. But the reality is that gambling can be very destructive. It can ruin relationships, lead to bankruptcy, and even cause suicide.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help. There are many resources available for those who need it. You can find help through Gamblers Anonymous or your local drug and alcohol agency.

#  Casinos Lose Billions in Unclaimed Prizes

Casinos around the world are estimated to lose billions of dollars in unclaimed prize money each year. This money could be used to improve the casinos’ facilities, reward their customers, and increase profits; but instead it sits unused because players don’t bother to collect their winnings.

In most cases, cashing in a casino prize is easy. Players simply present their winning tickets at the casino cage and receive their money. However, a large number of people never bother to claim their wins, likely because they either forget or assume the casino will contact them if they have won.

The amount of unclaimed prize money varies by country, but it’s estimated that casinos in the United States lose around $600 million each year. In Europe, the figure is closer to €1 billion ($1.1 billion). And in Macau – the global gambling capital – unclaimed prizes amount to an incredible $3 billion per year.

Casinos are not happy about this situation, as it means they’re losing out on potential revenue. But there’s not much they can do about it; apart from increasing awareness of how and where to collect prizes, there’s not much that can be done to motivate players to claim their winnings.

This issue is particularly relevant at a time when casino revenues are declining around the world. In Macau, for example, casino profits have dropped for six consecutive months as Chinese gamblers take their business elsewhere. Unclaimed prize money is one factor contributing to this decline; if more players were aware of and collected their winnings, casinos would stand to make more money.

So next time you hit a jackpot or score big at your local casino, remember to go and collect your prize!

#  Taxpayers Foot the Bill for Gambling-Related Expenses

Americans for Tax Reform recently reported that the cost of gambling-related expenses totals more than $100 billion annually. This number includes not just the money lost by gamblers, but also the money spent by taxpayers to cover the costs of government programs that deal with gambling addiction and its related problems.

The report notes that, while some of this money goes to essential programs like mental health care and crime prevention, a good chunk of it is wasted on things like unnecessary regulation and misguided attempts to encourage responsible gambling. For example, a recent study found that Louisiana spends more than $1 million each year on ads designed to discourage people from gambling, despite the fact that this activity generates more than $300 million in revenue for the state.

At the federal level, much of the money spent on gambling addiction and related problems comes from programs like Medicaid and Social Security. These programs are already struggling to meet the needs of millions of Americans, and so every dollar spent on gambling addiction is a dollar that can’t be used to help those who truly need it.

Ultimately, taxpayers are footing the bill for a problem that they didn’t create. Gambling addiction is a serious issue, but it doesn’t need to be treated as such by government officials. There are better ways to deal with it, and taxpayers would be better off if they stopped wasting their money on ineffective solutions.

#  State Lotteries Suck Money Out of Poor Neighborhoods

Across the United States, state lotteries are a big business. In 2017, they took in more than $80 billion in revenue. That’s more than twice the amount of revenue brought in by the NFL, and more than triple the amount brought in by Major League Baseball.

What most people don’t realize, though, is that a large chunk of that money comes from poor neighborhoods.

In a report published earlier this year, researchers at Duke University looked at lottery spending in North Carolina. They found that while the poorest residents of the state spend the greatest proportion of their income on lotteries, they also earn the least money.

The same thing is happening all across the country. A study published last year by The Urban Institute found that households earning less than $13,000 a year spend an average of 9 percent of their income on lottery tickets. Households earning more than $200,000 spend just 1 percent.

So why are poor people spending so much money on lotteries?

For many people, lotteries offer a chance to escape poverty. In a survey conducted by The Atlantic in 2014, nearly half of respondents said that playing the lottery was their only hope of ever becoming millionaires.

And for some people, lotteries offer hope in other ways as well. Many low-income families don’t have access to quality education or good jobs. The prospect of winning the lottery can seem like their only chance for a better life.

But what these people don’t realize is that state lotteries are actually making their lives worse.

Lotteries prey on people who are struggling financially and convince them to waste their limited resources on tickets instead of investing in things that could actually improve their lives. They also divert money away from important programs like education and healthcare.

State legislators know this all too well, which is why they often use Lotteries as a way to raise money for things like education and infrastructure projects. In 2016, for example, Connecticut raised more than $500 million through its state lottery program. More than half of that money went towards education initiatives.

But while state legislators may be happy to take advantage of poor people’s desperation, they don’t want to talk about it publicly. When pressed about it, they often claim that lotteries are “a voluntary tax on bad decisions” or that “the poor are not stupid enough to blow all their money on lottery tickets”.

These statements may make lawmakers feel better about themselves, but they do nothing to help the millions of people who are struggling financially because of state lotteries

#  The Cost of Gambling Addiction: More Than $40 Billion a Year

Gambling addiction is a problem that impacts people from all walks of life. It doesn’t matter if you’re rich or poor, young or old, male or female – anyone can develop a gambling addiction. In fact, the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) reports that as many as two percent of the United States population may have a gambling addiction.

This means that approximately 6 million Americans are dealing with a gambling addiction of some kind. And while this number may seem small, the cost of gambling addiction is actually quite staggering. According to a report from NCPG, problem gamblers generate more than $40 billion in costs every year. This includes costs related to crime, healthcare, and lost productivity.

That’s right – gambling addiction costs the United States economy more than $40 billion dollars every single year. To put this in perspective, that’s more than the GDP of over 100 different countries.

So what exactly are these costs? Let’s take a closer look:

1. Crime: One of the biggest costs of gambling addiction is crime. The NCPG reports that problem gamblers are three times more likely to commit crimes than non-problem gamblers. This includes everything from petty theft to embezzlement and fraud. In fact, one study found that nearly 60 percent of criminal offenders had a serious problem with gambling.

2. Healthcare: Gambling addiction can also have serious consequences for your health. The NCPG reports that problem gamblers are more likely to suffer from mental health disorders like depression and anxiety. They are also more likely to abuse alcohol and drugs, which can lead to further health problems. All of these factors can lead to increased healthcare costs for individuals and society as a whole.

3. Lost Productivity: Gambling addiction can also have a negative impact on your job performance and productivity. The NCPG reports that problem gamblers are twice as likely to miss work due to illness or injury and are four times more likely to call in sick during the workweek. They are also less productive when they are at work, due to their focus on gambling instead of their job duties. This lost productivity can cost businesses billions of dollars each year.
