#  What Revenue did the NFL earn in 2017?

The NFL earned a total of $14.3 billion in revenue in 2017, according to data released by the league. That’s up from the $13.3 billion earned in 2016, and is a new record for the league.

Of that $14.3 billion, $8.9 billion came from national broadcast rights deals, while the other $5.4 billion came from things like ticket sales, concessions and parking.

The NFL’s national broadcast deals are with CBS, NBC, Fox, ESPN and DirecTV. The agreement with CBS and NBC expires at the end of the 2022 season, while the other deals expire at different times between 2021 and 2024.

It’s no surprise that NFL revenue continues to grow each year, as the sport has become increasingly popular both in the U.S. and worldwide. The league is currently working on a new set of internationally-focused broadcast agreements, which are expected to be announced later this year.
