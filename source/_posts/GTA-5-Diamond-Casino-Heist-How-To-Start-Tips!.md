Online: In order to start the Diamond Casino Heist online, you must first reach level 8 or higher and own a high end apartment. Once you meet these requirements, access the "heist" option from your "toys" section and select "start heist." You will then be prompted to choose a crew leader. After selecting your crew leader, select "start heist." You will then be taken to a lobby where you can join up with other players or invite friends to join your crew.
