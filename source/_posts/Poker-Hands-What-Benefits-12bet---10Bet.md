#  Poker Hands What Benefits 12bet - 10Bet

Poker hands are the rankings of poker hands. They are used to determine the winner of a poker game. Poker hands rank from best to worst. The different types of poker games have different numbers of betting rounds and different numbers of players, but in each game, the ranking of the hands is the same.

In standard poker, there are 52 cards in the deck, and five cards are dealt face down to each player, followed by a single card face up. The face-up card is called the "flop." After the flop, another card (the "turn") is dealt face up, followed by a final (the "river") card which is also turned over. The best possible hand is a royal flush, composed of an ace, king, queen, jack and ten all of the same suit. In descending order: an ace high straight flush (A-K-Q-J-T), four of a kind (444), full house (33-3), flush (555), straight (6666), three of a kind (222), two pair (333), one pair (111) and high card.

## Poker Hands 


A poker hand consists of five cards. The cards are ranked according to their face value, with the ace being the highest rank and the two being the lowest rank. In a poker game, the players are initially dealt two cards each, and then a number of community cards are placed face-up in the middle of the table. The player with the best possible five-card poker hand wins the pot.

There are many different variations of poker, but all forms of poker require players to make one of three types of decisions: fold, call, or raise. Players can only bet as much as is in front of them, so if there is $10 in front of them and they want to bet $9, they must first fold $1 into the pot. When all players have either folded or put in an equal amount of money (called a "raise"), the betting round ends and a new one begins with the player who was last to act in the previous round.

 Different poker hands are worth different amounts, depending on the game being played. In most games, a Royal Flush (ace-king-queen-jack-ten) is always worth the most money, followed by a Straight Flush (five consecutive cards all of the same suit), Four of a Kind (four cards of the same rank), Full House (three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank), Flush (five cards all of the same suit), Straight (five consecutive cards not all of the same suit), Three of a Kind (three cards of one rank), Two Pair (two different pairs), and finally One Pair (two cards both of which are equal).

In general, when comparing two hands that both contain pairs, the hand with higher pairs is ranked higher. For example, if someone has two queens and someone else has two sixes, then Queens would beat Sixes. If both players have two identical pairs (e.g., both have two jacks), then whoever has highest ranking card outside their pair beats everyone else. So if player A has jacks high and player B has kings high, then player A would win even though they both have two jacks. If both players have no pairs at all, then whoever has highest card wins.
